      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        Contained within these pages are instructions on how to create a fairly standard LAPP stack with the end goal of
         hosting a “Dungeon Crawler Experience.” In this specific case, the LAPP stack is Linux, Apache, PHP and 
         Postgres. These instructions will help you set up your own Virtual Machine in the Google cloud, on one of 
         the more lightweight options. For linux, we chose Ubuntu 20.04. At time of writing (3/12/2024) this 
         application stack uses the current versions of Apache, PHP and Postgres.
      </p>
      <p>
        By following the instructions contained in these pages, you too can learn how to have the small and lightweight 
        “Dungeon Crawler RPG On Demand” game, made by Red Pangilinan, a person who has absolutely no connection us, externally hosted!

      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Dynamic dungeon generation</li>
        <li>Turn-based combat system</li>
        <li>Character customization</li>
        <li>Multiple levels with increasing difficulty</li>
        <li>High-quality graphics and sound effects</li>

      <h3>Future Plans</h3>
      <p>
        We plan to continue to host instructions on how one can set up this game, regardless of if these steps change in the future, in their current format. We leave it as a dedication to the way things were at the time of writing, 
        as a bulwark against an ever changing and uncaring world.
